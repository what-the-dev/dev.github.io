### fastai: Deep Learning for Coders 2020 course

I am currently making my way through the [2020 version](https://course.fast.ai/) of the course. My primary goal is to share my progress as I go. My secondary goal is to apply my knowledge to some projects and areas I am interested in. 

Note, the lesson numbers do not correspond to the fastai lesson numbers. This is because multiple notebooks are sometimes covered in one lecture, where it makes sense, I have kept these as part of a single notebook rather than separate.
